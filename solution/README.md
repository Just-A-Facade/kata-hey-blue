# Solution

[Overview](overview.md)

* Principles (high level architecture principles)
* Considerations (Storage, Security, Extendibility, Maintainability)
* Domain Model / High Level architecture diagram

[System Design](systemDesign.md)

* Context Diagram
* Container Diagram
* Core Components ( Component Diagrams, descriptions, risks, associated -ilities, evaluate if Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS))
* User Interaction (Mockups)

[Architecture Analysis](architectureAnalysis.md)

- Architecture Comparison (based on -ilities, compare architecture models)
- Architecture Analysis (overall analyse best match)
- Conclusion

[Deployment](deployment.md)

* Platform (expected Traffic, System Capacity and Availability)
* Engineering Practices (CI/CD, Monitoring, Observability, Feature Flags, 12 factors)
* Data security compliance

[Roadmap](roadmap.md)

 * Reccomend iterations and MVP scope
