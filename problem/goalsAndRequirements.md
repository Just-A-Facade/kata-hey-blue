# Goals and Requirements

Connecting civilian with policeman is the key functionality (~30m)
Managing reward points and experience around redeeming it would be critical to user experience (civilian)
Ability to find the right charity and donate to it easily
Easy on-boarding for civilian and police officer
Flexibility in mapping points per interaction type and trying out different strategies for their effect

What pushes the civilian to sign-up and turn on location ? The reward only?
