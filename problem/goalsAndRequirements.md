# Goals and Requirements

## Background

The Hey, Blue! initiative facilitates moments of meaningful connection between police officers and members of their community by offering intentional opportunities for individuals to meet and share positive experiences.

### Vision

Inspired by the extraordinary acts of heroism displayed by both individual community members and first responders during 9/11, EcoSchoolco-founder, John Verdi, wanted to build a platform that could bring police officers and communities together with a shared purpose.
Connection-driven projects like Preschool Storytime and Hello, a virtual handshake, are just the start of a larger movement designed to create an awareness of our shared humanity.
If police officers across the United States simply connected with 5 community members per day, the result would be 1.2 BILLION connections in a year.<br />
