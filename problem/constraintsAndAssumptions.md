# Constraints and Assumptions

## Constraints
1. The system must guarantee high security to protect sensible user data.
2. The initial architecture in this repository must be completed by November 8th, 11:59PM Eastern.

## Assumptions
1. Data collected during interaction can be considered transient.
2. Data analysis to track engagement can be anonymous.
3. No sensitive data is exchanged during interaction, so no end-to-end encryption is required.
