# Architectural Kata Spring 2022 - Just A FaÃ§ade

> **_NOTE:_**  
Dear O'Reilly Architecture Katas jury,  
we realized that the amount of time required to submit a decent solution outnumbers the amout of time we are able to inveset for this short timeframe. This is necessary because we mostly do the exercise in our spare time.  
Unfortunately, you won't find a complete solution by November 8, but we really like the exercise and we decided to continue on our own pace allowing sufficent time for internal discussions instead of rushing it.  
Best regards, Just-A-Facade team!
